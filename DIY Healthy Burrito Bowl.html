        <div class="desc__text">I like to make my own burrito bowls for a few reasons, the first being that I like knowing EXACTLY what goes into my food. And while restaurants seemingly have simple ingredients, you don't really know what all is used to cook their veggies, or how much salt is in their salsa, etc.
<br><br>
When you make your own food, you know every single thing that is going into your tummy. And that is a good feeling!
<br><br>
Especially for foods like this burrito bowl, when it's going to be delicious even if you didn't add one pinch of salt or oil, you might as well make it as healthy as possible and make it a power meal.

            <ol>
                <li class="list1">Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet with half a tablespoon of coconut oil. Season your tofu with paprika, onion powder, salt and pepper. Lay flat on the baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the tofu is firm and golden.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Cook quinoa according to direction. This will take approx. 15 minutes so make sure it is the first thing you get cooking once the tofu is in the oven.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Add 1 tablespoon coconut oil to a large skillet and bring to medium heat. Add garlic, bell pepper, and onion. Saut√© for approx. 10 minutes or until the veggies are tender.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Add the remaining coconut oil to a medium skillet and bring to medium heat. Add your corn and cook for 5-10 minutes, depending on if you are using fresh or frozen and how roasted you want your corn to be. I like mine slightly browned so I will cook them as long as possible.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">In a medium sauce pan, add the can of black beans (do not drain them!). Add a pinch of salt and cook over medium until they are hot.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">While all of your veggies are cooking, prepare your tomatoes and avocado in a way that you like. I prefer my tomatoes diced and my avocado mashed up like guacamole.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Once everything is done cooking, layer your bowls in the following order: quinoa, black beans, pepper and onion, tofu, corn, tomatoes, avocado/guacamole, salsa. Serve warm.</li>

<br><br>
I recently got an intense craving for a meaty, tomatoey soup with lentils and greens and had to have it. This was the (incredibly delicious) result.
<br><br>
We hope you love it as much as we do. It’s been on repeat in our kitchen for the last several months! Let us show you how easily it comes together.</div>

            <div class="instr__name">INSTRUCTIONS</div>
            <ol>
                <li class="list1">Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil. Let heat 30 seconds. Then add onion and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and sauté until soft and translucent (~ 4 minutes), stirring frequently. Then add garlic and red pepper flake and sauté 1 minute more.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Add beef or bison and use spoon to break into small pieces. Then season with another healthy pinch each salt and pepper. Stir and cook until meat is browned (~4-5 minutes).</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Add tomato paste and stir to combine. Then add diced tomatoes (with their juices), broth, dried basil, and dried oregano and stir. Add (drained) beans or lentils (both from canned*), season with another pinch salt and pepper, and stir.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Once simmering, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more red pepper flake for heat, tomato paste for tomato flavor / depth of flavor, salt and pepper to taste, or dried herbs to taste.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Add kale and one final pinch each salt and pepper, then stir. Cover and cook for a few minutes more, or until kale is wilted and green.</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Serve hot as is, or garnish with fresh minced parsley, vegan parmesan cheese, and red pepper flake (all optional).</li><br>
                <li class="list1">Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Thaw from frozen before reheating. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop in a saucepan or pot over medium heat (covered) until warmed through. Add more broth or water as needed to thin.</li>

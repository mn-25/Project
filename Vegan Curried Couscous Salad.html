        <div class="desc__text">I am really loving this curried couscous salad right now, for many reasons. One reason being that it's really easy to make. It only takes about 20 minutes start to finish, and 15 of those minutes are the pot sitting on the stove and you not doing anything.
           <br><br>
           It's also easy to eat. And by that I mean it's a good grab-and-go lunch (or any meal for that matter). You don't need to warm it up in a microwave for it to be delicious. You don't need to add anything else to it. What I'm saying is, you can make a batch of this Sunday night and use it all week at your convenience.
<br><br>
I also love this curried couscous because it's really healthy. Couscous packs a lot of health benefits. To name a few: promotes healthy metabolism, improves digestion, builds muscle, and helps prevent certain cancers. Not too shabby! Then there's the curry and turmeric powders which are like superfood powders from the gods.
